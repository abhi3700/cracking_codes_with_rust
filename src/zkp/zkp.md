# Zero-Knowledge Proof

## Concepts

There are 3 main components in a ZKP system:

- **Prover**: The party that wants to prove the knowledge of a secret without revealing it. Here, the prover has to generate the proof from witness and send it to the verifier.
- **Verifier**: The party that wants to verify the prover's knowledge of the secret without learning the secret itself. Here, the verifier has to verify the statement sent by the prover. In blockchain systems, the verifier can be available in form of a smart contract or node.
- **Statement**: The claim or assertion that the prover wants to prove without revealing any additional information (non-interactive). It is the fact or proposition that the prover knows to be true and wants to convince the verifier of its truth without disclosing any sensitive details.

There are 2 additional components that are used in ZKP systems:

- **Witness**: secret information that the prover knows. The witness is used to generate the proof. Mathematically, for instance a secret info is a point that lies on a straight line or curve. Now, the curve is the proof and the point is the witness. And the verifier can verify the statement using proof with some arbitrary point(s) on the curve and hence, the witness is not known and still the statement is verified. [Code example](../../../proj/zkp/langs/noir/hello). In this code example, the statement is pretty simple `x != y`. But we can have more complex statements.
- **Proof**: The proof is the evidence generated by the prover to convince the verifier of the statement's truth without revealing the witness (the secret information that the prover knows). In ZKP systems, the proof is designed in such a way that it does not leak any sensitive information about the witness, and the verifier can independently verify the proof without further communication. In Aztec protocol, using noir we can create a statement that satisfies the points like witness (secret) and inputs (`Prover.toml` file content). Then, we can generate the proof using `noir prove` command. And finally, we can verify the proof using `noir verify` command. [Code example](../../../proj/zkp/langs/noir/hello).

## Applications

### Blockchain

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that addresses two major issues in blockchain technology: scalability and privacy. In a ZKP, one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the fact of the statement's truth. This technique has significant implications for blockchain technology.

#### Scalability

Blockchain networks face scalability challenges due to the need for every node to verify data. This full node verification process can lead to slower transaction times and increased network congestion. ZKP offers a solution to this problem by allowing a single verifying node to verify the submitted proof for the data sent to the network. Other nodes can then simply add the verified data (by one node) into their local copy of the blockchain, resulting in reduced finality time and increased scalability.

#### Privacy

In public blockchains, all data is visible, which can lead to privacy concerns. ZKP-based cryptography, such as the BLS family of Elliptic Curves, can guarantee privacy by allowing users to prove the validity of a statement without revealing the statement itself. This enables confidential transactions and data sharing while maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain.

### Voting

ZKP can be used to ensure the integrity of voting systems. For example, a voter can prove that they voted for a particular candidate without revealing their identity or the candidate they voted for. This allows for anonymous voting while ensuring that the votes are counted correctly.

### Login systems

ZKP can be used to authenticate users without revealing their identity. For example, a user can prove that they have a valid login credential without revealing their username or password. This allows for anonymous authentication while ensuring that the user is authorized to access the system.
