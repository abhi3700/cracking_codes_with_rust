# Public-key cryptography

Encryption and decryption using public-key cryptography.

## Concepts

There are mainly two types of cryptography:

- **Symmetric-key cryptography**: In this type of cryptography, the same key is used for encryption and decryption. The key is shared between the sender and receiver. The key is kept secret and not shared with anyone else. Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, RC4, RC5, RC6, CAST5, IDEA, Skipjack, Serpent, etc.
- **Public-key cryptography**: In this type of cryptography, there are two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption. The public key is shared with everyone and private key is kept secret. Examples: RSA, ECC, ElGamal, DSA, etc.

## Applications

- Digital signatures using public-key cryptography.
- Key exchange using public-key cryptography.
