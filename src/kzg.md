# KZG Commitments

If you are curious, why KZG, then refer to the [FAQs](#faqs) section first.

## FAQs

**Q**. Why KZG?

**A**. They can replace Merkle Tree variants (like Merkle Mountain Range (MMR), Merkle Patricia) with a _constant size_ proof (48 bytes). The merkle proof size grows with the number of leaves in the tree. KZG commitments are _constant size_.

**Q**. Does KZG follow normal polynomial? If not what it is and Why do we need a different polynomial?

**A**. No, here polynomials are defined over a finite field. This means that when doing arithmetic operations on the coefficients, the result is always reduced modulo the field's characteristic. For instance, each coefficient is an element of the field Fp, where p is a prime number. For more view [examples](#code).

E.g. `f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1` is a polynomial over a finite field Fp, where p is a prime number. Here, the coefficients are 3, 2, 1. The degree of the polynomial is 2.
g(x) = 2x^2 + 1 is also a polynomial over a finite field Fp, where p is a prime number. Here, the coefficients are 2, 0, 1. The degree of the polynomial is 2.

When we add them, we get `f(x) + g(x) = 5x^2 + 3x + 2`. Here, the coefficients are 5, 3, 2. The degree of the polynomial is 2. This happens in case of normal polynomials. But, with FF, the coefficients are reduced modulo the field's characteristic.

> Although the result with FF would also be same in this case as the sum result is within the large prime number (if considered as boundary).

Now, why do we need to define a normal polynomial over FF?

To construct commitments to these polynomials. The KZG scheme allows for efficient proofs of certain properties of the polynomial (like polynomial evaluations) without revealing the polynomial itself. Hence, has similar properties to a Merkle Tree.

Analogy:

| Merkle Tree              | KZG Commitments                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Leaf                     | Polynomial coefficients                |
| Root                     | Polynomial commmitment i.e. polynomial |
| Proof                    | Proof                                  |
| growing size with leaves | constant size i.e. 48 bytes            |

**Q**. Does KZG have constant size proof?

**A**. Yes. KZG proofs maintain a constant size regardless of the polynomial's degree or the size of the data structure they're proving. Specifically, for certain elliptic curves like BLS12_381, the proof size is consistently 48 bytes. For other curves, need to verify via code.

## Code

> `rust-kzg` is the main repo being used in production code. Other KZG libs are mostly experimental. Need to be audited.
>
> There are other libs like [`ralexstokes-kzg`](https://github.com/ralexstokes/kzg) which shows a small example of KZG commitments implementation like zkSNARKs. But, it is not being used in production code. [This](https://github.com/abhi3700/My_Learning_Cryptography/blob/main/libs/kzg_playground/examples) contain all possible examples of KZG commitments, polynomial arithmetic, etc.

There is a repo: [rust-kzg](https://github.com/sifraitech/rust-kzg) with 2 packages:

```toml
kzg = { git = "https://github.com/sifraitech/rust-kzg.git", package = "rust-kzg-blst" }
kzg_traits = { git = "https://github.com/sifraitech/rust-kzg.git", package = "kzg" }
```

Here, the `kzg` is called for the rust-kzg-blst package and `kzg_traits` is called for the kzg package of the [repo](https://github.com/sifraitech/rust-kzg).

Some [examples](https://github.com/sifraitech/rust-kzg/libs/kzg_cookbook/examples/) based on polynomials.

The examples are based on KZG polynomials i.e. polynomials defined over a finite field (for computers 256-bit selected).

**Quick heads up before coding**:

- Each `limb_t` element is represented as `[u64; 4]` array because of BLST crate.
  > Reason: Technically it's possible to represent as `U256` instead of `[u64; 4]`, but the
  > computers (32/64 bit) are good in 64-bit arithmetic by default. So, it
  > would be easy to do the arithmetic operations if considered as
  > `[u64; 4]` instead of `U256` type altogether.
  > Moreover, `rust-kzg` crate would be difficult to interface with BLST lib (interface with blst curve).
- The array is wrapped within `blst_fr` struct like this:
  ```rust
  struct blst_fr {
      l: [limb_t; 4usize],
  }
  ```
  > Reason: BLST crate uses this struct to represent a field element.
- The `blst_fr` struct is wrapped within `FsFr` struct like this:
  ```rust
  struct FsFr(blst_fr);
  ```
  > Reason: To make it easy to use the `FsFr` struct in the code.
- The polynomial is represented as a vector of `FsFr` struct
  ```rust
  pub struct FsPoly {
      pub coeffs: Vec<FsFr>,
  }
  ```
- Each polynomial is represented as vector of coefficients with order 0 to n (where n is the degree of the polynomial). The order of the coefficients is important.
  ```rust
  // f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
  let f = FsPoly {
      coeffs: vec![
          FsFr::from(1u64),
          FsFr::from(2u64),
          FsFr::from(3u64),
      ],
  };
  ```
